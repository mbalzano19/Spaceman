# Spaceman
Spaceman is an iteration of the classic game "Hangman". The objective of this game is to correctly guess all of the letters in a hidden word. To win the game, guess all of the letters that are in the hidden word. If you guess incorrectly too many times and run out of guesses, you lose the game.

# Getting Started

[Click to Play Spaceman!](https://mbalzano19.github.io/Spaceman/)

To begin playing Spaceman, simply click a letter to make a guess. If the letter is in the hidden word, you will see it appear in it's respective position within the hidden word. If the letter you guess is incorrect, you will see an element of the Spaceman rocketship displayed on the screen. You will also see your number of incorrect guesses left decrease by 1. Continue clicking letters to make more guesses. If the number of incorrect guesses left reaches 0, you will have lost the round. The entire Spaceman rocketship will be shown, and it will animate and fly away. If you correctly guess all of the letters in the hidden word, the entire word will be displayed on the page. Whether you win or lose, you will see a message telling you the result of the round. At the end of each round, a restart button will appear on the page. Click this button to play another round with another hidden word.

# Next Steps

- Add feature that allows user to pick from multiple categories of hidden words. Currently, there is one category, which is animals
- Add animation to each rocketship image when it appears on the page. Currently, there is only animation at the end of the game when the final rocketship image is displayed
