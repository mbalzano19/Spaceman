# Getting Started

[Click to Play Spaceman!](https://mbalzano19.github.io/Spaceman/)

To begin playing Spaceman, simply click a letter to make a guess. If the guessed letter is in the hidden word, that letter in the hidden word will be displayed on the screen. If the letter you guessed is incorrect, you will see an element of the Spaceman rocketship displayed on the screen. You will also see your number of incorrect guesses left decrease by 1. Continue clicking letters to make more guesses. If the number of incorrect guesses left reaches 0, you will have lost the round. The entire Spaceman rocketship will be shown, and it will animate and fly away. If you correctly guess all of the letters in the hidden word, the entire word will be displayed on the page. Whether you win or lose, you will see a message above the letter board telling you the result of the round. At the end of each round, a restart button will appear on the page. Click this button to play another round with a new hidden word.

# Next Steps

- Add feature that allows user to pick from multiple categories of hidden words. Currently, there is one category, which is animals
- Add animation to each rocketship image when it appears on the page. Currently, there is only animation at the end of the game when the final rocketship image is displayed
- Add more graphics to the buttons
- Add sound effects for the rocketship and for when letters are guessed
